# OPC UA W3C WoT Working Group Charter (Draft)

## Purpose 
The OPC UA W3C WoT Working Group is a joint initiative of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) (https://www.w3.org/WoT/) and the 
OPC Foundation (https://opcfoundation.org/). The purpose is the development of an OPC UA Binding 
for the W3C Web of Things through an OPC UA Companion specification and mirrored as a W3C Recommendation/Note(?) docuement.

## Scope
<tbd>

### OPC Foundation
OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation 
space and in other industries. It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among devices 
from multiple vendors. The OPC Foundation is responsible for the development and maintenance of this standard.

### W3C
The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards 
and guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known 
standards HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies upon which websites are built. W3C works on ensuring that all foundational 
Web technologies meet the needs of civil society, in areas such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and privacy. W3C also 
provides the standards that undergird the infrastructure for modern businesses leveraging the Web, in areas such as entertainment, 
communications, digital publishing, and financial services. That work is created in the open, provided for free and under the 
groundbreaking W3C Patent Policy. For its work to make online videos more accessible with 
captions and subtitles, W3C received a 2016 Emmy Award. And for its work to standardize a Full TV Experience on the Web, 
W3C received a 2019 Emmy Award.
