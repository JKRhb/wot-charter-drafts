# OPC UA W3C WoT Working Group Charter (Draft)

## Purpose 
The OPC UA W3C WoT Working Group is a joint initiative of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) (https://www.w3.org/WoT/) and the 
OPC Foundation (https://opcfoundation.org/). The purpose is the development of an OPC UA Binding 
for the W3C Web of Things through an OPC UA Companion specification and mirrored as a W3C Recommendation/Note(?) docuement.

## Scope
Web of Thing (WoT) should support a standardized binding to OPC UA systems to enable simple application development like for cross-domain 
applications. OPC UA is one of the prominent automation standards for device communication in the factory domain as well as for Industry 4.0 
scenarios such as flexible manufacturing. 

Such a binding for the WoT needs its own set of OPC UA specific vocabulary definitions, which should be developed collaboratively. In the context of the existing [liason](https://opcfoundation.org/news/opc-foundation-news/w3c-and-opcf-to-integrate-opc-ua-into-the-web-of-things/) a joint 
working group should be established to work together on an OPC UA binding for the Web of Things. This guaranteed that the binding is getting accepted within the OPC UA community as well as in the WoT community and avoids heterogeneous (project specific) definitions and incompatible OPC UA handlings in WoT Thing Descriptions.
 

### OPC Foundation
OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation 
space and in other industries. It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among devices 
from multiple vendors. The OPC Foundation is responsible for the development and maintenance of this standard.

### W3C
The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards 
and guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known 
standards HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies upon which websites are built. W3C works on ensuring that all foundational 
Web technologies meet the needs of civil society, in areas such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and privacy. W3C also 
provides the standards that undergird the infrastructure for modern businesses leveraging the Web, in areas such as entertainment, 
communications, digital publishing, and financial services. That work is created in the open, provided for free and under the 
groundbreaking W3C Patent Policy. For its work to make online videos more accessible with 
captions and subtitles, W3C received a 2016 Emmy Award. And for its work to standardize a Full TV Experience on the Web, 
W3C received a 2019 Emmy Award. 


## Working Group 

### Structure of working group

### Membership
The working group is open to any employee or representative of a member of the OPC Foundation or the W3C. 

### Working Group Meetings 

The working group meets as needed. Meetings may be electronic or in person. The frequency and form of the meetings will be established as the working group forms. 

Face-to-Face and electronic meetings will be organized jointly by W3C and the OPC Foundation.
