# W3C Web of Things Group Charters

As decided in the [WebConf on 27 Apr 2016](https://www.w3.org/2016/04/27-wot-minutes.html), we now use the following process for our charter work:

## Process

* We start with a charter template only containing boilerplate (i.e., no specific content) in https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/master/charters
* Each envisioned topic must be formulated in an individual draft and must open a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) ("PR").
* We discuss the envisioned topic using GitHub comments on the [corresponding PR](https://github.com/w3c/wot/pulls) (the "Files changed" tab also allows to comment on individual lines).
* The original author is responsible to update the open PR with new commits according to the discussion.
* Only when the participants reach consensus (i.e., no more objections in the comments), W3C staff merges the PR into the master branch.
* The current status of the charter document is accessable for everyone over the w3c.github.io page.
* Feedback on the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/) is still possible and welcome. A directly appointed helper or otherwise the W3C staff is responsible to create corresponding comments or pull-requests on GitHub.

## Howto

### Web-site based

* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c/wot#fork-destination-box) the `w3c/wot` repository into your own account
* Navigate to http://github.com/{your-account}/wot/blob/master/charters/wot-ig-2016.html or http://github.com/{your-account}/wot/blob/master/charters/wot-ig-2016.html
* Click the edit icon in the upper right (pen next to Raw/Blame/History)
* Make your edits (e.g., directly in the online editor or by copying the text to your favorite editor and back)
* Give a meaningful commit message (i.e., do not leave "Update ...")
* Choose *Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request* and give a proper name (e.g., `charter-ig-scope-plugfest`)
* Click *Propose file change*
* Skip the form, since you do not want to create a PR to your fork. Go to https://github.com/w3c/wot instead, where GitHub will have found your new branch and offer to open a pull-request.

### Command-line based

* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c/wot#fork-destination-box) the `w3c/wot` repository into your own account
* Create a branch in your fork for one particular topic (e.g., a single IG scope item) with a proper name (e.g., `charter-ig-scope-plugfest`)
* Make your edits and commit
* Push the new branch to your own repository fork
* GitHub will automatically offer to open a pull-request to `w3c/wot` (from your new branch to master)

## Help

* https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ provides a tutorial on GitHub pull-requests.
* If you have not worked with GitHub in this way before, we will give direct assistance.
