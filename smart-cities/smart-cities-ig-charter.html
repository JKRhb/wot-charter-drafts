        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p><!-- Brief background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry. -->
<!-- Original text, kept for reference.  
	During the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/schedule.html#day2">Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things</a>,
        the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) gave an
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/Presentations%20-%20Day%202/02_W3C%20WOT%20FINAL.pdf">exciting presentation</a>
        on the need for standardization in the context of Smart Cities.
        Since then, GovTech has been participating in the discussion on possible next-gen WoT use cases within the WoT-IG's Use Cases TF,
	and has contributed several use cases for Smart Cities, including for
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/master/USE-CASES/smartcity-geolocation.md">geolocation</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/master/USE-CASES/smartcity-health-monitoring.md">public health monitoring</a>.
	Additional use cases being worked on that are relevant to Smart Cities include logistics and transportation,
	digital twins, Smart City dashboards, discovery, and edge computing.

        The WoT IG has also created a [https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/PoC_WebConf Proof of Concept Task Force]
        for the possible system applications of WoT technology to Smart Cities and Retail verticals, 
	and we're several more participants in that TF, e.g., Conexxus, Fiserv, Fraunhofer,
        Hitachi, Intel, IRI, Oracle, Siemens and UPM in addition to Singapore GovTech.

        However, since several Smart Cities topics (for example, data management and visualization, or cloud application portals) 
	go beyond the scope of the WoT charter, we felt that a separate
        Interest group that focused on Smart City use cases and requirements was appropriate.
        We're generating a draft Charter for the expected Interest
        Group with the important stakeholders including GovTech, Intel,
        Conexxus, Fiserv, Fraunhofer, Hitachi, IRI, Oracle, Siemens and UPM.	      
	</p>

        <p><strong>Needs reworking.  Should not focus so much on WoT, needs to balance with other topics
        of relevance to Smart Cities.
        Would be good to have sections for "topics" and "tasks".  Drafts follow.
        </strong></p>

            high priority Smart City use cases, possibly through the creation of Task Forces;</li>
          <li>Incubation of technical solutions for the identified requirements by
            supporting the creation of Community Groups or Business Groups focusing on
            particular topics;

          <li>Suggesting existing Working Groups to include particular topics in
            their scope as appropriate;</li>
          <li>Suggesting the creation of new Working Groups to address particular topics if no
            existing Working Group is appropriate;</li>
          <li>Tracking and review of Smart City-related deliverables developed by
            other W3C groups, and reporting of issues as appropriate;</li>
          <li>Coordination with other organizations to
            gather knowledge, coordinate input into W3C efforts, and promote
            development and use of W3C standards within Smart City applications;</li>
          <li>Ensuring issues of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, performance, privacy, and security are given
          equal consideration in all discussions and outcomes.</li>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants 
          for its duration.
          The chairs and editors are expected to contribute half of a working day per week 
          towards the Interest Group. 
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, 
          comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, 
          as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions 
          for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required 
          (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: 
          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived 
          for public review, 
          and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that 
          can be both read and written to by the general public. 
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of deliverables will be developed on a 
          public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
          The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group 
          (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, 
          participants, and meetings) 
          will be available from the <a href="">Smart Cities Interest Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Smart City Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of 
          particular deliverables, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work 
          on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list 
          for administrative purposes and, 
          at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, 
          for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, 
          per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> 
          W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. 
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not 
          achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented,
          the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation,
          any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting
          or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions 
          (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey),
          with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>,
          depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period,
          the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the 
          Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until 
          new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the 
          Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document 
          (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> 
          and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a>
          of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. 
          For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
