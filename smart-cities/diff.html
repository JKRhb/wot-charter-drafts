refers
to
a
range

for

of
our

As

rises,
we
see

from

to

However,

So
W3C
organized
a

on
Smart

in
June
2021
to
finalize
this

We

Smart
City
applications
are
tightly
related
to
the
people
who
live
in
cities.
We
want

Standards
are
essential
for
Smart
City
technology
and
business
development.
Standards
benefit
vendors,
cities,
and
users.
For
vendors,
standards
unify
markets
and
mean
that
a
larger
market
can
be
addressed
with
a
single
product
design,
allowing
products
to
more
efficiently
make
returns
on
the
investments
needed
to
develop
them.
For
cities,
standards
allow
the
deployment
of
technologies
that
can
be
sourced
from
multiple
vendors,
more
and
higher
quality
products,
and
increases
the
probability
that
systems
will
remain
usable
over
a
longer
timescale.
Standards
also
encourage
the
development
of
open
systems
that
can
interoperate
with
other
standardized
systems,
multiplying
the
number
of
use
cases
that
can
be
addressed.
For
users,
standardized
technologies
mean
that
services
available
in
one
city
will
also
be
available
in
others,
facilitating
mobility.
</p>
<p>
However,
we
need
to
know
what
standards
should
be
developed
to
achieve
these
objectives.
What
gaps
exist?
What
opportunities
can
be
exposed
by
standards
that
enable
new
use
cases?
What
are
the
business
drivers
that
encourage
adoption
of
standards,
and
how
can
standard
development
be
aligned
with
these
drivers?
Given
a
set
of
standards
that
could
be
developed,
what
are
the
priorities?
How
can
the
needs
and
goals
of
all
stakeholders
be
aligned?
</p>
<p>
The
purpose
of
this
Interest
Group
is
collect
and
connect
Smart
City
stakeholders
to
answer
these
kinds
of
questions
and
drive
the
development
of
web
technology
standards
aligned
with
the
real
needs
of
Smart
Cities.
</p>
<p>
The
topics
that
the
Interest
Group
will
address
include
but
are
not
limited
to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Transportation,
both
public
and
private;
</li>
<li>
Logistics,
including
last-mile
delivery
of
goods
and
services;
</li>
<li>
Infrastructure,
including
IoT-based
sensing
and
actuation;
</li>
<li>
Signage,
addressing
the
problem
of
timely
delivery
of
information
to
a
diverse
population;
</li>
<li>
Open
data
portals,
including
network
APIs
to
data
services
and
the
development
of
app
ecosystems;
</li>
<li>
Data
management,
facilitating
the
rapid
ingestion,
storage,
and
dissemination
of
data
</li>
<li>
Edge
and
cloud
computing,
allowing
computation
to
be
efficiently
applied
when
and
where
needed;
</li>
<li>
Payments,
to
allow
services
to
be
monetized,
encouraging
new
business
development
and
cost
recovery;
</li>
<li>
Privacy,
to
preserve
the
rights
of
citizens
and
other
stakeholders;
</li>
<li>
Security,
to
preserve
the
integrity
and
safety
of
systems
and
protect
users;
</li>
<li>
Accessibility,
to
incorporate
design-for-all
thinking
throughout
all
aspects
of
smart
city
infrastructure,
and
ensure
accessibility
for
people
with
disabilities
in
every
activity
and
at
every
stage
of
life;
</li>
<li>
Internationalization,
to
support
diverse
populations
and
tourism.
</li>
</ul>

Participation
</h2>
<p>
To
be
successful,
this
Interest
Group
is
expected
to
have
6
or
more
active
participants
for
its
duration.
The
chairs
and
editors
are
expected
to
contribute
half
of
a
working
day
per
week
towards
the
Interest
Group.
There
is
no
minimum
requirement
for
other
Participants.
</p>
<p>
The
group
encourages
questions,
comments
and
issues
on
its
public
mailing
lists
and
document
repositories,
as
described
in
<a href='#communication'>
Communication
</a>.
</p>
<p>
The
group
also
welcomes
non-Members
to
contribute
technical
submissions
for
consideration
upon
their
agreement
to
the
terms
of
the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">
W3C

</a>.
</p>
<p>

in

are
required
(by
the

to
follow
the
W3C

Most

will
focus
on
discussion
of
particular
deliverables,
and
will
be
conducted
on
an
as-needed
basis.
</p>
<p>
This

primarily
conducts
its
technical
work
on
<a class= "todo" id="public-github" href="[link%20to%20Github%20repo]">

The
public

<p>
The

use
a
Member-confidential
mailing
list
for
administrative
purposes
and,
at
the
discretion
of
the
Chairs
and
members
of
the

for
member-only

in
special

when
a

such
a

<section id="decisions">
<h2>
Decision
Policy
</h2>
<p>
This
group
will
seek
to
make
decisions
through
consensus
and
due
process,
per
the
<a href= "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">
W3C
Process
Document
(section
3.3)
</a>.
Typically,
an
editor
or
other
participant
makes
an
initial
proposal,
which
is
then
refined
in
discussion
with
members
of
the
group
and
other
reviewers,
and
consensus
emerges
with
little
formal
voting
being
required.
</p>
<p>
However,
if
a
decision
is
necessary
for
timely
progress
and
consensus
is
not
achieved
after
careful
consideration
of
the
range
of
views
presented,
the
Chairs
may
call
for
a
group
vote
and
record
a
decision
along
with
any
objections.
</p>
<p>
To
afford
asynchronous
decisions
and
organizational
deliberation,
any
resolution
(including
publication
decisions)
taken
in
a
face-to-face
meeting
or
teleconference
will
be
considered
provisional.
A
call
for
consensus
(CfC)
will
be
issued
for
all
resolutions
(for
example,
via
email,
GitHub
issue
or
web-based
survey),
with
a
response
period
from
<span id='cfc'>
one
week
to
10
working
days
</span>,
depending
on
the
chair's
evaluation
of
the
group
consensus
on
the
issue.
If
no
objections
are
raised
by
the
end
of
the
response
period,
the
resolution
will
be
considered
to
have
consensus
as
a
resolution
of
the
Interest
Group.
</p>
<p>
All
decisions
made
by
the
group
should
be
considered
resolved
unless
and
until
new
information
becomes
available
or
unless
reopened
at
the
discretion
of
the
Chairs
or
the
Director.
