# WG 2021 Extension Plan
We will request a 6mo extension to the WG charter, based on the following plan: 
1. Roll back TD spec to 1.1 (1.0 compatible) features by Nov 30
2. Feature freeze TD 1.1 spec by Dec 15 
3. Feature freeze Discovery spec by Dec 15 
4. Publish all FPWDs by Jan 13 (this is the last possible date, but earlier is better if we want to publish CRs earlier than the last possible date!)
5. Feature freeze Profile spec by Jan 31 
6. Testfest in mid-Feb 
7. CR transition in mid-March
8. PR transition in mid-April
9. REC transition before end of extended charter end of July
