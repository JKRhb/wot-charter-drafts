# WG 2021 Extension Plan
We will request a 12mo extension to the WG charter, based on the following plan.
Note however that the spec generation schedule is based on a 6 month extension plan.
The additional 6 months will be used as a buffer for wide review and testing.
During the second 6 months we can begin editor's draft documents for the planned WG rechartering for 2023.
