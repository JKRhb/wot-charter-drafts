      <p class="mission">
        The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by introducing a Web-based abstraction layer capable of interconnecting existing Internet of Things platforms and complementing available standards.
        We aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect.
        As a W3C Interest Group, we are seeking to build a deeper understanding of the Web of Things by investigating consumer, industrial, and smart cities scenarios.
        This is intended to identify opportunities for further standards track work within W3C working groups and to better align with the established W3C liaisons.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a lack of interoperability across platforms.
          As a result developers are faced with data silos, high integration and maintenance costs, and limited market potential.
          This can be likened to the situation before the Internet, when there were competing non-interoperable networking technologies.
          The Internet makes it easy to develop networked applications independently of those technologies.
          The W3C is seeking to do the same for the Internet of Things with the Web of Things.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve this goal for cross-platform interoperability, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">W3C Web of Things Working Group</a> is finalizing a first set of standardized building blocks.
          They are based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively.
          The central documents are the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> with its <i>Properties, Actions, Events<i> interaction model.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Web of Things Interest Group continues its work to support the Working Group and to explore opportunities for new standards track work within W3C.
          The priority of the third charter period will be on enabling open markets of services on the scale of the Web.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        <p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">Scope Summary</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Support the Web of Things Working Group</li>
            <li>Organize and run PlugFests to evaluate the current working assumptions in regards to Web of Things</li>
            <li>Reach out and collaborate with interested organizations, vendors, and communities in support of the Interest Group's mission</li>
            <li>Explore areas and identify work that is ready for transfer to the W3C Recommendation Track</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      <a href="wot-ig-2019-relationship.png"><img id="relationships" src="wot-ig-2019-relationship.png" alt="relationship between WoT IG and WG" /></a>
      The Web of Things Interest Group (WoT IG) is a forum for discussion of ideas relating to the Web of Things and is intended to complement the role of the Web of Things Working Group.
      In particular, the Interest Group will propose new work items for the Working Group based upon new use case considerations and discussions with IoT developer communities, industry alliances, and standards development organizations.
      Vice versa, the Interest Group will consider new topics that are submitted to it by the Working Group.
    </p>

    <p>An important activity is the operation of PlugFests to collect interoperability implementation experience and to validate the current working assumptions of the technological building blocks discussed in the Web of Things Interest Group as well as proposed Working Group. These events enable developers to get together to test their implementations and facilitates networking between partners and experts. The Interest Group will seek to encourage work on open source projects and community evaluation of the Web of Things. In more detail, PlugFests allow participants to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>assist with preparing implementation reports for WoT WG Candidate Recommendations</li>
      <li>test-drive upcoming or proposed technologies for the W3C Recommendation Track</li>
      <li>take part in interoperability experiments across implementations for ideas at different levels of maturity</li>
      <li>reach out to other communities and new Members through an OpenDay for non-Members, which usually includes a demo track</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Interest Group will identify requirements for standardization in two ways: first, by exploring use cases and requirements for concrete consumer, industrial, and smart cities application scenarios, and second, through examining the requirements for integrating a broad range of IoT platforms into the Web of Things.
      Two areas that have already been identified as critical by the WoT WG are simplified APIs for application developers, hypermedia concepts for complex Actions and Events that have a lifecycle on their own (e.g., Properties about the progress of a running Action or an Action to cancel a running or queued Action).
      The Interest Group will work on these in coordination with external groups to address their needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the mid term, the Interest Group is expected to work on WoT infrastructure services such as directories and proxies as well as overall secure Thing lifecycle management including management interfaces for systems hosting Things.
      This would include an evaluation of new semantic technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">JSON-LD&nbsp;1.1</a> (in particular management of remote contexts and framing) and new work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html">Web Standardization for Graph Data</a>.
      This work would combine implementation experience with in-depth analysis.
      The Interest Group is seeking to broaden the range of participants to provide the necessary skills and resources to conduct this work.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the long term, the Interest Group will use the practical experience gained from these experiments as a basis for identifying new work items.
      One topic will be the creation of Thing Description Profiles, constraining the set of TD features and extensions, to enhance interoperability within a certain application domain, for instance, a vendor-neutral Web platform for apps that are installed on home gateways, or usage as technology-neutral asset administration shell for Industry 4.0.
      Further ideas for topics are expected from discussions and expert presentations of IoT projects, including for example, edge computing and machine learning.
      The Interest Group will incubate work items for the Web of Things until they are ready for transfer to the W3C Recommendation Track, either in existing Working Groups, such as the Web of Things Working Group, or in new working groups.</p>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>
            The technical development of standards is not in scope for the Interest Group.
            Identified Recommendation Track opportunities will be handed over to appropriate W3C groups if such a group exists, or within a dedicated Community Group or Business Group when incubation is needed.

        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review after FPWD and before CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Communication
        </h2>

    <p id="public">Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.</p>

    <p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Interest Group home page.</a></p>

    <p>Most Web of Things Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>

    <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wot-ig@w3.org">public-wot-ig@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.</p>

    <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and Members of the group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
